This lists the API changes between releases of the package.


Upgrading to 2.0
================

  - Horde_Data

    The factory method has been removed. Directly instantiate a transport
    driver instead.

  - Horde_Data_Base

    The constructor now requires a Horde_Data_Storage object to be passed in
    as the first argument.

  - Horde_Data_Csv

    The static helper method getCsv() was added.

  - Horde_Data_Storage

    Temporary data storage has been abstracted out to this class.
